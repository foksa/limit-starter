# Usage Window Starter

A macOS menu bar app, built with [Electrobun](https://framework.blackboard.sh/electrobun/) and a Go backend, that watches the Claude and Codex 5-hour usage limits. When a 5h session has reset and is idle, it sends one short message to start the next one.

Besides the regular check interval (10 min by default), it checks once more right after each running session's reported reset time: 30 s later for Codex, which reports exact seconds, and 90 s for Claude, whose `/usage` shows minutes only. That way the next session starts within about a minute of the reset.

The menu bar shows the time left in each running 5h session, for example `C 4:30 · X 2:18`. It shows `–` when a session is idle or outside active hours, and `!` after an error. During a check it keeps the last time left, so the text doesn't change width; the panel shows "Checking…". Clicking it opens a panel with each provider's 5h and weekly usage, a **Start** button when a session is idle, **Check now** (↻), **Settings** (⚙), an **Auto-start** switch, **Check for updates…**, **Open log**, and **Quit**. Click outside it or press Esc to close it.

It checks for a new version once a day and downloads it in the background. When it's ready, you get a notification and the panel offers **Install version … & restart**.

It uses only the official CLIs, run headless, with your subscription login. There are no direct API calls:

| | limit check (no model call) | start message |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `claude -p "/usage"` | `claude -p … --model <model> --tools "" --no-session-persistence` |
| Codex | `codex app-server` → `account/rateLimits/read` | `codex exec --ephemeral -m <model>` |

## Models
- **Claude**: the aliases `haiku`, `sonnet` and `opus` always point to the newest model in that family. A custom full model id also works.
- **Codex**: the list comes live from your installed Codex (`model/list`), so it follows Codex updates. If a saved model is no longer offered, Settings marks it and you get a notification the first time a start message fails.
- Use **Send test message** in Settings to try a model before saving. It uses a tiny bit of your limit, and starts a 5h session if none is running.

## Develop / build
The backend is Go (`src/go`: the app in `package main`, the logic in `core`, the updater in `updater`). The panel and Settings views are TypeScript (`src/panel`, `src/settings`, shared types in `src/shared`).

```sh
bun run dev        # hutch run dev: builds and launches the dev app
bun run build      # hutch run build: "build/stable-macos-arm64/Usage Window Starter.app"
bun run test       # Go tests: parsers, scheduling rules, updater checks
bun run typecheck  # the TypeScript views
```
`scripts/go.sh` runs the Go toolchain Hutch installed, so no separate Go install is needed.
`USAGE_WINDOW_STARTER_OPEN_SETTINGS=1` opens the settings window on launch, and `USAGE_WINDOW_STARTER_OPEN_PANEL=1` opens the panel. With the built app, run `open --env USAGE_WINDOW_STARTER_OPEN_SETTINGS=1 <app>`.

Hutch installs to `~/.hutch/bin`. Run `hutch electrobun sync` once after cloning to create the `.hutch/devkit` types.

## Release
1. Bump `app.version` in `electrobun.config.ts` and `package.json`, then commit and push.
2. Run `bun run release`. It runs the tests, builds the stable app, and publishes `artifacts/*` as GitHub release `v<version>` with `gh`.

Installed apps fetch `stable-macos-arm64-update.json` from the latest release (`release.baseUrl`), download the full app, and hand it to Electrobun's native update helper, which replaces the app and restarts it. Dev builds never update.

## CLI
A dev tool for checking things without the app, for example what the parser sees after a CLI update. It's the same binary with a subcommand, and it shares the same config and state. `bun run status` (or `sh scripts/go.sh run ./src/go status`) shows each provider's 5h and weekly usage and whether it would start a session now; `start <claude|codex>` sends a start message now; `models` lists the models you can pick. The built app's binary works too: `"<app>/Contents/MacOS/main" status`.

## Files
- `~/.usage-window-starter/config.json`: settings (edited by the Settings window)
- `~/.usage-window-starter/log.jsonl`: one line per check or start
- `~/.usage-window-starter/state.json`: last snapshot and start time for each provider
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.foksa.usage-window-starter.login.plist`: only when **Launch at login** is on

If a CLI update changes the `/usage` text, the Claude check fails loudly. No start message is sent, and the menu bar shows `!`. Update `ParseUsage` in `src/go/core/claude.go` and add the new output to `src/go/core/testdata/`.
